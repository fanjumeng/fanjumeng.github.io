# About us

 Welcome! The Meng lab is part of the [Department of Biological Sciences](https://biology.unt.edu/) at the University of North Texas!
 
 We study the molecular mechanisms regulating gene expression programs during embryogenesis. Our current work focuses on epigenetic regulators. Our goal is to understand how our genome is decoded to facilitate developmental fate transitions during embryogenesis. 

 **<u>We are actively looking for passionate graduate students and undergraduate students to join us!</u>**
 
 **Graduate students** - For prospective gradaute students, we are part of the [graduate program](https://biology.unt.edu/graduate-programs) of the Department of Biological Sciences. If you are interested in joining our lab as a graduate student, please send Fanju your CV and research interest for further discussion.
 
 **Undergraduate students** - We welcome motivated undergraduate students to join us. Please send Fanju an email for further discussion if you are interested in learning about of our work!
